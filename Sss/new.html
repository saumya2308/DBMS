    <label for="q1">Who collects user fee?</label>           
    <p>In case of Public Funded/ Annuity/ SPVs Govt. collects the user fee (toll) by engaging the contractors through competitive e-bidding, whereas in private investment/ OMT Projects, the Concessionaire collects the user fee (toll). </p>

     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">Why full user fee (toll) is to be paid although we travel a small length on the project road? </label>           
    <p>In India, the tolling is generally under the open system, whereby fee payable is a fixed amount based on the length of stretch under one project which is normally 60 kilometers. If a stretch is of lesser length, user fee of actual length only is collected. </p>

     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">Why the user fee (toll) rate is different at 2 Toll Plazas? </label>           
    <p>User fee on a particular fee plaza is based on stretch length under that plaza, structures (bridge, tunnel, bypass) and width of the highways, applicable fee rules and provisions of the concessions agreement. </p>

     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">The categories of vehicles and their rates are different?</label>           
    <p>Vehicles are categorised for the welfare of road users. This categorisation is primarily based on the size and load they carry and damage done to the road and type of use (commercial/personnel) of a vehicle. </p>
    
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">What is normal minimum distance between two adjacent Toll Plazas? </label>           
    <p>As per the fee rules 2008 the spacing between two adjacent toll plazas should be 60 km. The broad reasons for establishing fee plaza within a distance of 60 kms are as under: 
Availability of land
Availability of sufficient long line of sight for acceleration and deceleration zone.
Municipal limit/Town area limit from the fee plaza being established.
Location of bypass from the fee plaza being established.
Location of major diversions on the National Highways.
State boundaries and other check posts.
Existence of a fee plaza on the section of NH and length of new section to be tolled is below 60 kms.
Optimisation of revenue potential.
To make the project viable, two fee plazas are established in a project section of NH within 60kms distance.
The development work of the NH is considered as per requirements.
Therefore, two adjoining sections constructed at different time in separate contracts having length of less than 60 kms may have the fee plazas within 60 kms.
Distance between two adjacent toll plazas may be less than 60 km due to unavailability of land, traffic congestion or improper location etc.</p>
    
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">Why concessions to local/ frequent users are different? </label>           
    <p>Concession to local/frequent users are extended as welfare measures. There may be variation in the concessions available as these have been provided at different times under different fee rules and provisions of concession agreement. </p>
     
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">Why the formula and the date of annual revision of user fee across the toll plazas are different? Why rounding of fee in some toll plazas is Re.1/- and Rs.5/- in others? </label>           
    <p>Annual revision is done w.e.f. 1st April and fee is to be rounded off to the nearest Rs 5 as per the new user fee rules. However some roads built before 2008 are governed by old ruleswhere fee is rounded off to Re 1 only. </p>
     
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">User fee collection started even though the project is not completed.</label>           
    <p>User fee is levied and collected as per applicable fee rules and provisions of the concession agreement. In some cases, user fee collection is allowed when project is 75% complete. This helps people to use the completed part of the road and traveller pays only for the 75% length opened for traffic. </p>
     
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">The Concessionaire has collected user fee (toll) more than the expenditure incurred by him. Why he is allowed to continue with toll collection?</label>           
    <p>User fee is levied and collected as per applicable fee rules and provisions of the concession agreement. As per rule, a concessionnaire has right to collect user fee till the completion of concession period allowed under the agreement. 
</p>
     
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">How long a toll plaza shall be in operation? What is the duration for which the user fee shall be collected at any toll plaza ?</label>           
    <p>Once a highway is built, Fee is to be collected to recover the cost. Once cost is recovered the fee is collected at reduced rate of 40% as the road is to be maintained in good condition for the travellers.</p>
     
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">The list of exempted vehicles is not uniform in the projects. </label>           
    <p>List of exempted vehicles is different as exemptions have been granted under different rules prevailing at the time of construction of the road. </p>
     
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">Whether Ex-Servicemen are exempted from payment of user fee.</label>           
    <p>No.</p>
     
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">I am a winner of Police Medal/ Padmashree. Am I entitled for exemption from payment of user fee? </label>           
    <p>No.</p>
     
     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">I am a central government/ state government officer. Am I entitled for exemption? </label>

     <input type="checkbox" id="q1">
    <label for="q1">The procedure for getting the pass for local users. </label>           
    <p>The Concessionaire shall formulate, publish and implement an appropriate scheme and make such modifications to the scheme as may reasonably be suggested by the Authority or by Local Users from time to time (Ref. Clause 27.3 of Concession Agreement). 
</p>

    <label for="q1">Penalty for overloaded vehicles.</label>           
    <p>The excess load is to be removed and a penalty equal to 10 times the applicable fee is to be paid. This is applicable to all projects/ all Concession Agreements.</p>
